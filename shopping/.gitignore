# Git Ignore for PHP/MySQL Projects

# Vendor directories
/vendor/

# Composer generated files
composer.lock

# XAMPP/WAMP/MAMP/LAMP specific files (if any are generated in your project root)
# Be careful with this, only if they are temporary or sensitive
# For example, if you have a config file outside of your code base that stores sensitive data, don't commit it.
# A common practice is to have a config.php.example and a config.php that's ignored.
# config.php

# Log files
*.log

# OS generated files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

# Node.js (if applicable)
/node_modules/

# Environment variables files (if you use them, e.g., for database connection)
.env
.env.*

# Temporary files or IDE-specific files
*.tmp
*.swp
*.bak
.idea/
